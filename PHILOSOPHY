    I should build 
    what I see
    If I build what  I     
    see I can build what    
    I think, therefore I build.
    
    / Ten Coding Rules /
    
    1. Forget classes, compose in functions
    2. Everything is a Dictionary, List, or Set 
    3. No strage loops: Comprehensions are your friends
    4. No Global variables, use only pure functions
    5. Functions can return tuples; use them freely
    6. Compose, Reuse, Refactor = Simple, Simpler, Simplicity
    7. Forget databases, Redis is good
    8. Be open, be flexible, remember to curate good practices
    9. If you run out of gas, there's always Clojure
    10. Eat your own pie
