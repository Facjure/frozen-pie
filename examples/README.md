This is a sample site created using frozen pie.

All pages, blog posts are stored under *docs*.

Templates, Styles, and Logic, is stored under the *recipe* namespace.

Site configuration is in config.yml.

As you see, content, design, and logic is distributed across the filesystem--yet frozenpie brings them together, and generates a static site, complete with back button, and responsiveness.

Simplicity *is* possible.
