This is a sample site created using frozen pie.

Instead of creating new content, we'll reuse contents from the root docs/ folder. In fact, we'll create a static site that acts as project documentation for github projects.

Templates, Styles, and Logic, are stored under the *recipe* namespace.

Optional site configuration, like first page, title, etc., is stored in config.yml.

As you can see, content, design, and logic is distributed across the filesystem--yet Frozen Pie brings them together, and generates a static site, complete with back button, and responsiveness.

Simplicity *is* possible.
