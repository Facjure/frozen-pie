### Tech

Built using functional programming techniques. There is no state, no framework, just a single workflow that lets content creators, designers, and developers work in parallel.

**Content** can be anything: blog-post, page, navigation, header, footer, wiki, sitemap, etc., The type can be identified by reading the content's metadata.

**Template** accepts content with same type. For example a user should be able to take a _blog_ content and stick it into any _blog_ template. He can't, however, stick a _home_ content into a _nav_ template.

**Style** breathes life into Templates. They can be written in CSS3, or compiled from LESS, SCSS, Bourbon.

**Lambdas** are logic written in any language that supports functional concepts like Javascript, Coffeescript, Clojurescript on the browser, or Python on the serverside.
