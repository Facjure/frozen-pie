### Tech

Built using functional programming techniques.

**Content** can be anything: blog-post, page, navigation, header, footer, wiki, sitemap, etc., The type can be identified by reading the content's metadata.

**Template** accepts content with same type. For example a user should be able to take a _blog_ content and stick it into any _blog_ template. He can't, however, stick a _home_ content into a _nav_ template.

**Style** adds a theme into Templates. They can be written in CSS3, or compiled from LESS.

**Lambdas** are pre-compiled logic (Mustache Lambdas) written in Python.
