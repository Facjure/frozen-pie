## Abstract

Most cms platforms today are blog and database centric like wordpress, drupal, tumblr, weebly: platforms where users drag and drop designs with **content buried in code**. Designs are coupled with cms, content _can't_ be read outside them. Designing websites around a cms locks you in with a toolkit, an online service, an agency charging your money for no real value. Static site generators, jekyll, middleman, and over [a hundred variations](http://nanoc.ws/about/) of the same idea, simplify website development by an order of magnitude, replacing databases with filesystems and promoting Markdown over editors. However, you have to be a developer to customize them.

Things shouldn't be this way.

Editors and publishers should be able to write templates by hand, buy reusable themes, add, edit content, **script an editorial workflow**, and host a site on dropbox. No lock-ins, no contracting agencies, no cms.
