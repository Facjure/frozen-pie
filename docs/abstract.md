## Abstract

Static site generators, jekyll, middleman, frozen flask, and over [a hundred variations](http://nanoc.ws/about/) of the same idea, simplify website development by an order of magnitude, replacing databases with filesystems and promoting Markdown over WYSISYG editors. However, they don't provide a tight integration with css themes and client-side routes. Too many templating choices make integration hard with a common content repository.

Things shouldn't be this way.

Stick to a lightweight language agnostic template engine (Mustache), implement logic as pure functions (Mustache Lambdas), routes with SammyJs, and responsive themes with Bootstrap; you have a pre-compiled webapp rendered as a static site.

You can prepare the content, add recipes with themes, routes, and functions, and bake them into a single responsive page, like a frozen pie.
