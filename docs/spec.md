### What?

create_crust
> Cook creates content in Markdown/Plain Text with YAML meta-data. A content can be anything.

add_fillings
> Designers create generic Templates with Mustache, and optionally, 3rd-party logic (Mustache lambdas), and package them as 'Recipes'.

bake
> Cook heats everything into a single index.html

serve
> Cook serves the single page to anywhere: github pages, S3, dreamhost, email, etc.,

Optionally, purchase Recipes (crust, fillings, frozen) and bake!
