**Ten Coding Rules**

1. Forget classes, compose in functions, think of modules, namespaces
2. Everything is a Dictionary, List, or Set
3. No strage loops: Comprehensions are your friends
4. No Global variables, use only pure functions
5. Functions can return tuples; use them freely
6. Compose, Reuse, Refactor = Simple, Simpler, Simplicity
7. Forget databases
8. Be open, be flexible, remember to curate good practices
9. If you run out of gas, there's always Clojure
10. Eat your own pie
