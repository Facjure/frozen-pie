I started this project with my brother on July 10th 2013, hoping to learn functional programming and idiomatic Python. What happend in three weeks changed the way I think. We ended in [12th place](http://www.julython.org/teams/), and with a foundation, I hope, is the future of publishing.

Simplicity _is_ possible.
