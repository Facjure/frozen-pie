# Create Content Together

How do you write content once, pick any template, add themes, build an editorial workflow with dead simple hosting? What if there were no lock-ins with cms platforms, frameworks, programming languages, and toolkits?

To understand what can be done, we must look at what _can't_ be done.

## Overview

Most content platforms today are blog and cms and database centric like wordpress, drupal, tumblr, even weebly: platforms where users drag and drop designs with **content buried in code**. Designs coupled with platforms, content that _can't_ be read outside the platforms.

Designing websites around these 'platforms' means you are locked in to their workflow, their language of choice, their opinions, and if you disagree you need a deep understanding of their toolkit—if it's opensource—to hack your way in.

Static site generators, on the other hand, simplify website development by an order of magnitude by replacing databases with filesystems, by eliminating complex servers, and choosing conventions. Frameworks like jekyll, middleman, docpad, and over [a hundred variations](http://nanoc.ws/about/) of the same idea are excellent, get the work done. They're built for developers and designers who like to take control.

This is great, but they break an important rule: Coupling.

They couple at least two of the following: _authors, designers, developers, hosting providers_.

Logic is mixed in with templates, css is often tied to templates, and plugins—that extend your website's design or logic—are not portable across toolkits, not even the same language. When you add up authors, developers, and publishers using these tools, you end up with millions of lines of code, design, templates, and _content_, incompatible with each other, only to become obsolete after the _next best thing_.

Things shouldn’t be this way. Not in 2013.

## Usage

Steps:

Rememeber how you baked a pie?

- prepare
  > Prepare crust: prepare content in Markdown/Plain Text with YAML meta-data. A content can be anything.

- add_recipes
  > Add Templates with Mustache, and optionally, 3rd-party logic (Mustache lambdas), packaged together as 'Recipes'.

- bake
  > Heat everything into a single index.html

- serve
  > Serve an index page, anywhere: S3, dropbox

What's more, add recipes--pre-configred templates with styles ready to serve.

Setup:

    $ mkvirtualenv pie
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Run:

    $ cd pie
    $ python pie.py

Tests:

    $ cd pie-test
    $ py.test test/tests.py

## Status and Roadmap

Currently in *research & development*. Not stable.

This work is being done in parallel to Poetroid, an open platform to discover poetry together with a unified [api](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) for web, mobile, and print.

It is being used internally in three sites by our editors to continuously integrate content, code, and design on the fly.
