> You know you have reached perfection in design, not when there is nothing more to add, but when 
there is nothing more to be taken away - Antoine de Saint-Exupery


Today's static site generators require css, markup, templating and programming skills. Their compatibility is broken. A template in one framework doesn't work in the other. You can't mix and match languages, and add custom features in a decoupled way. You can't take a Designer's template and pipeline lambdas and data structures in a straight forward way.  And then you check for hosting, browser compatibility, plugins that blow on your face. 
 
These toolkits are built for a different web, for a different skillset. It requires a lot of work to perform simple tasks. Things shouldnâ€™t be this way.

Not in Python.
