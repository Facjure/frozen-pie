Can you publish a blog with markdown and YAML, as a single index.html ?

## Process
1. Prepare the Crust by reading Markdown document and YAML Config data  
2. Shake on a Pan by adding the Crust to a Mustache Template  
3. Add ingredients by choosing a stylesheeti, javascript  
4. Pick a Recipe. A recipe is nothing but a Mustache lambda (TODO)  
5. Bake. This generates the final index file with wrapped html, js, css includes etc
