# Frozen Pie

A minimalist static site builder, written in Python and SammyJs.

Out-of-the box support for client-side routing, regex search, and responsive grid layouts with Bootstrap.

## Why

I prefer manipulating text with Python, design my templates in Mustache, and let a stupid builder re-assemble my pages with Bootstrap, on the fly.

For more info, see [sample site](http://priyatam.github.io/frozen-pie/) (generated by Frozen Pie) for details.
