> You know you have reached perfection in design, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to be taken away -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

## Overview

If I can see what I write
I should build
what I see, If I can build what
I SEE
I can build what
I think therefore I build.

A minimalist website builder for semantic content with an emphasis on Plain text, Markdown, HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Web Design, and injectable Lamdas.

## Three principles

1. Content is King
2. Design once, View anywhere
3. Logic should be declarative, composed of single tasks

Here's a sample workflow:

## How it works

Author = Cook

create_crust
> Cook creates content in Markdown/Plain Text with optional YAML meta-data. A content can be anything.

put_in_pan and add filling
> Designers create generic Templates with Mustache, and optionally, 3rd-party logic (Mustache lambdas), and package them as 'Recipes'.

add_recipes
> Cook selects Recipes

bake_in_oven
> Cook heats a script to compile everything into a single index.html

serve
> Cook runs the script to see his/her page live on github pages, S3, and even as a attachments in email

## Behind the scenes
Markdown, Mustache, HTML 5, CSS3 (SCSS/Bourbon), SammyJs. SammyJs will be a part of the toolkit and not required by Users.

Toolkit built in Python with pure functions, lamb days, and partials. No state, no framework, just a single workflow that lets content creators, designers, and developers work in parallel.

Lambdas analyze inline content with data stored elsewhere. Lambdas can be written in Python, Javascript, Coffeescript, and Clojuresript, any functional language and packed together to import into recipes.

Content authors can learn how to run basics of command line, git, Markdown, and that's okay.

It's time we give them power.
