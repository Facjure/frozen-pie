# Frozen Pie

A minimalist static site generator and router, written in Python and Javascript. Out-of-the box support for client-side routing, search, and responsive grid layouts with Bootstrap.

## Why

Publishing a minimal, interactive, and responsive site should be as simple as baking a frozen pie: prepare, mix, bake, and serve.

See [docs](http://priyatam.github.io/frozen-pie/) (generated by Frozen Pie) for details.
