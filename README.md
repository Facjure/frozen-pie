# Literary publishing, for humans

A mobile-first, literary publishing toolkit that fits in your **dropbox**.

## Usage

Note: The current steps are still developer-centric. Human api will be available soon.

Setup:

    $ mkvirtualenv pie
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Run:

    $ cd pie
    $ python pie.py

Tests:

    $ cd pie-test
    $ py.test test/tests.py

## Status and Roadmap

Not stable. Currently in *Research & Development*.

This work is being done in parallel to Poetroid, an open platform to discover poetry together with a unified [api](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface). Poetroid is currently used internally by our editors for [curating poems from the public domain](https://github.com/Facjure/poetroid-public-domain).

## Documentation

Coming soon.

## Contributers

- Priyatam Mudivarti: writer, engineer, and founder of Facjure LLC
- Sreeharsha Mudivarti: musician, engineer, and survivor of a space ship crash.
