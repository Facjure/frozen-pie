# Frozen Pie

> You know you have reached perfection in design, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to be taken away -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

## Overview
A minimalist website builder for semantic content with an emphasis on plain text, HTML5, CSS3, and Responsive Web Design.

## Three principles

1. Content is King
2. Design once, View anywhere
3. Logic should be declarative, composed of single tasks

Here's a sample workflow:

## How it works

create_crust
> Content creator creates Posts and Pages in Markdown/Plain Text, with optional YAML meta-data

put_in_pan and add filling
> Designers create generic Templates with HTML and Mustache, and optionally, 3rd-party logic (Mustache lambdas), and package them as 'Recipes'.

add_recipes
> Content creator selects Recipes

bake_in_oven
> Content creator runs a script to compile everything into a single index.html

serve
> Content creator runs the script see his/her page live on github pages

## Behind the scenes
Markdown, Mustache, HTML 5, CSS3 (SCSS/Bourbon), SammyJs.

SammyJs will be a part of the toolkit and not required by Users.

Python with pure functions. No state, no framework, just a single workflow that lets content creators, designers, and developers work in parallel. 

Lambdas analyze inline content with data stored elsewhere. Lambdas can be written in Python, Javascript, Coffeescript, and Clojuresript.

Content authors can learn how to run basics of command line, git, Markdown, and that's okay.

It's time we give them power.
