## Overview

A minimalist website builder for semantic content with an emphasis on Plain Text, Markdown, Mustache Templates, Mustache Lambdas,  HTML 5, and Responsive Web Design. 

## Abstract
How do you design a responsive website around semantic content? 

Current platforms are Blog and CMS centric like Drupal, Wordpress, Tumblr, Weebly or Static site generators like Jekyll, Middleman, DocPad etc., The former platforms are good for users who want to click and forget, and the latter for developers who like to hack. However, both these approaches break a simple rule: _Coupling_.

They couple at least two of the following: authors, designers, developers, hosting providers. Their styles are not compatible across frameworks. When you upgrade some plugins break, blow on your face. Designs, though written in CSS, seem coupled to classes and ids tied to the underlying toolkits; you can't port designs; you can't even move **Content** from one thing to another. Everything is locked to one framework, one language, coupling code and design.

Things shouldnâ€™t be this way.

## How it works

1. Content is King
2. Design once, View anywhere
3. Logic should be declarative, composed of single tasks

Author = Cook

create_crust
> Cook creates content in Markdown/Plain Text with YAML meta-data. A content can be anything.

put_in_pan and add filling
> Designers create generic Templates with Mustache, and optionally, 3rd-party logic (Mustache lambdas), and package them as 'Recipes'.

add_recipes
> Cook selects Recipes

bake_in_oven
> Cook heats everything into a single index.html

serve
> Cook serves the single page to anywhere: github pages, S3, dreamhost, email, etc.,

It's time we give them power.
