# Frozen Pie
        
> You know you have reached perfection in design, not when there is nothing more to add, but when 
there is nothing more to be taken away - Antoine de Saint-Exupery


Today's static site generators require css, markup, templating and programming skills. Their compatibility is broken. A template in one framework doesn't work in the other. You can't mix and match languages, and add custom features in a decoupled way. You can't take a Designer's template and pipe data structures and lambdas. You can't let them both work in total independence.

And then you check for hosting, browser compatibility, plugins that blow on your face. 
 
These toolkits are built for a different mindset. For different abstractions. It requires a lot of work to perform simple tasks, like changing design on the fly, add behavior on the fly with a single lambda, cook a frozen pie from recipe. Things shouldnâ€™t be this way. 

Not in Python.
