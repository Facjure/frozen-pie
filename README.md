Millions of stories live buried in word, pdf, blogs, and cms engines meant for developers. Thousands of sites struggle to keep up with the pace of technology, the complexity of frameworks and web. Publishers, even writers, need their own toolkit to compile and generate a static site.

Let's build one.

## Overview

A mobile-first, publishing toolkit that fits in your **Dropbox**.

Inspired by static-site generators like Jekyll, Middleman, and written in Python for humans.

Five parts: content, design, templates, scripts, and hosting

1. Write any content using Markdown/YAML
2. Choose coverpage, images, typography, color scheme, margins, page, story, article
3. Create your own template in a templating language for humans
4. Create custom editorial workflows with a scripting library for humans
5. Host your site from dropbox

## Status and Roadmap

In Development, v0.4. Unstable.

Developed in parallel to [poetroid](https://github.com/Facjure/poetroid).
