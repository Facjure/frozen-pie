# Frozen Pie

A minimalist static site generator and router, written in Python and Javascript. Out-of-the box support for client-side routing, search, and responsive grid layouts with Bootstrap.

## Why

Building a Bootstrap based static site should be as simple as baking a frozen pie: Prepare, add recipes, and bake content together.

## Api

_prepare_
> Prepare crust: prepare content in Markdown or Plain Text with YAML metadata. A content can be anything: blog, page, interactive search, live feed, etc.,

_add_recipes_
> Add templates with Mustache and themes with Bootstrap.

_bake_
> Compile content, logic, and styles into an index page with a router to navigate pages/content

_serve_
> Serve a single page to Github, Dropbox, or S3.

## Usage

Setup:

    $ mkvirtualenv pie
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Run:

    $ cd pie
    $ python pie.py

Tests:

    $ cd pie-test
    $ py.test test/tests.py
