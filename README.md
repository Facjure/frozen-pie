> You know you have reached perfection in design, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to be taken away -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

## Overview

How do you design a website for semantic HTML 5 content? 

Current frameworks and platforms areCMS and Blog centric, including Wordpress, Drupal, Tumblr, Weebly, Jekyll, Middleman, and  handcrafted Bourbon mixins with Sinatra.

They are great for developer, however, they all break a simple rule: _Coupling_.

They couple at least two of the following: authors, designers, developers, hosting. Their styles and templates are not compatible with each other, non-portable across frameworks. Plugins break when you upgrade the framework; you can't move plugins between frameworks, you can't port designs--you can't even move **Content** from one platform to another.

Things shouldnâ€™t be coupled this way.

## Three principles

1. Content is King
2. Design once, View anywhere
3. Logic should be declarative, composed of single tasks

## How it works

Author = Cook

create_crust
> Cook creates content in Markdown/Plain Text with YAML meta-data. A content can be anything.

put_in_pan and add filling
> Designers create generic Templates with Mustache, and optionally, 3rd-party logic (Mustache lambdas), and package them as 'Recipes'.

add_recipes
> Cook selects Recipes

bake_in_oven
> Cook heats everything into a single index.html

serve
> Cook serves the single page to anywhere: github pages, S3, dreamhost, email, etc.,

It's time we give them power.
