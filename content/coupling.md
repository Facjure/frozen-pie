How do you create semantic content and design a website around it? Wordpress? Tumblr? Weebly? Jekyll? Middleman? Custom CMS or handcrafted Sinatra app?

They all break a simple rule: Coupling.

These solutions couple at least two of the following: authors, designers, developers, hosting. Their styles and templates are not compatible with each other, non-portable across frameworks. You can't even move content from one platform to another.

Things shouldnâ€™t be coupled this way.
