The majority of digital publishing today uses a PHP based CMS. A large number of them use an off-the-shelf Wordpress or Tumblr blog. Nothing wrong with them. Except: they have no control over the framework.

Some content authors even email Microsoft Word docs to each other. Their massive cms platforms don't have REST. They don't support Markdown. They don't version control their content and distribute them to authors for offline viewing. Even those who know the web standards spend an awful lot of money to do little things. Things like upgrading software, merging content, exporting content from one format to another.

Yet, developers are obsessed with mvc frameworks, frontend toolkits, static site generators, this and that. Have you ever asked your non-programmer friend to create a website?

Reality Check: pick a framework, filter on language, understand its templating syntax, understand the framework to customize a workflow, modify non-portable css styles, check browser compatibility, hosting, responsiveness, pricing, and plugins that may or may not blow on your face. 

These toolkits are built for a different mindset. For different abstractions. Things shouldnâ€™t be this way.

Not in 2013.
