The majority of digital publishing today uses a PHP based CMS. A large number of them use an off-the-shelf Wordpress or Tumblr blog. Nothing wrong with them. Except: they have no control over the framework.

Some content authors even email Microsoft Word docs to each other. Their massive cms platforms don't have REST. They don't support Markdown. They don't version control their content and distribute them to an asset pipeline.

These things are foreign to most publishers. Even those who know spend an awful lot of money to do little things.

Yet, we, as developers, are obsessed with static site generators, mvc frameworks, frontend toolkits in javascript, this and that. Have you ever asked your non-programmer friend to create a custom website?

Reality Check: pick a framework, filter on language, understand its templating syntax, understand the framework to customize a workflow, modify non-portable css styles, check browser compatibility, responsiveness, hosting requirements, pricing, plugins that blow on your face.

These toolkits are built for a different mindset. For different abstractions. It requires a lot of work to perform simple tasks, like changing content and design on the fly, adding simple logic to analyze data, build, and release your content.

Things shouldnâ€™t be this way.
