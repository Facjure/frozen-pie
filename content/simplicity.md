Specifications like [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Semantic HTML 5](http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html), and [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io) let us focus on what needs to be done, not how. When you build systems around specs, you have freedom from language, platform, logic, even hosting provider. You can embrace pure functional programming & &#955; architectures. You can focus on building content that evolves in its own pace.

Simplicity _is_ possible.

1. Content is King
1. Use any Design
1. Logic is declarative
1. Host anywhere
1. Decouple everything
1. Go back in time
