Current content platforms are CMS centric like Wordpress, Drupal, Tumblr, Weebly which are good for users who want to click and drag and drop designs and logic. Design they can't control. Logic that they can't write themselves. Designing websites around these 'platforms' means you are locked in to their platforms.

They couple at least two of the following: _authors, designers, developers, hosting providers_.\n\nTheir styles are not compatible across frameworks. CSS styles are coupled to classes and ids of the underlying templates and toolkits. You can't port designs, you can't even move content from one platform to another without hacking your way through scripts and xml export hell. When you upgrade, some plugins break, blowing on your face. Everything is locked to a framework, a language, _leaving content behind_.
