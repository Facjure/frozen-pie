“You know you have reached perfection in design, not when there is nothing more to add, but when 
there is nothing more to be taken away.” 
               
                                                                - Antoine de Saint-Exupery


Today's static site generators require css, markup, templating and programming skills. Their compatibility is broken. A template in one framework doesn't work in the other. You can't convert from LESS to Bourbon, from HTML to HAML, from Ruby closure to a Python inner function. You can't use Clojure's immutable collections to reimplement a default Mustache _loop_ in a straight forward way. You test on browsers, they break, like plugins that blow on your face. 
 
These toolkits are built for a different web, for a different generation. It requires a lot of work to perform simple tasks, like editing content, scrolling through posts and pages, designing a custom layout and pipeline lambdas onto a designer-friendly page. Things shouldn’t be this way. 
    
Not in Python.
