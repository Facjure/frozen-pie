Today's static site generators require templating, markup and css, and even a programming skills, but their compatibility
is thoroughly broken. A template in one framework doesn't work in the other. You can't convert from LESS to Bourbon--you
can't reverse engineer HTML to HAML. You can't use your own language's data structures.

Some engineers repeat and re-implement the same concepts, duplicate libraries across languages. Where are the specs? I 
have to ask. And then you check for browser compatibility, upgrades, plugins, hosting, and so on.

These toolkits are built for a different web — for a different skillset, library fanboys. It requires a 
lot of work (even css overrides) to perform simple tasks. Things shouldn’t be this way. 

Not in Python.
