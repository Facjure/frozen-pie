Today's static site generators require templating, markup, css, and programming skills, but their compatibility
is thoroughly broken. A template in one framework doesn't work in the other. You can't convert from LESS to Bourbon. You
can't reverse engineer HTML to HAML or a Ruby closure to a Python closure. You can't use your own language's data structures.

Some engineers repeat and re-implement the same concepts, duplicate libraries across languages. And then you have to check for browser compatibility, plugins, broken plugins, hosting, and so on. These toolkits are built for a different web — for a different skillset. It requires a lot of work (even css overrides) to perform simple tasks, like viewing custom content on the web. Things shouldn’t be this way. 

Not in Python.
