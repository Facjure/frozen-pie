Today's static site generators require css, markup, templating and programming skills. Their compatibility is broken. 
A template in one framework doesn't work in the other. You can't convert from LESS to Bourbon, from HTML to HAML,
from Ruby closure to a Python inner function. You can't use Clojure's immutable collections to reimplement a default 
Mustache _loop_ in a straight forward way. You test on browsers, they break, like plugins that blow on your face. 
These toolkits are built for a different web, for a different generation. It requires a lot of work to perform simple 
tasks, like editing content, scrolling through posts and pages, designing a custom layout and pipeline lambdas onto 
a designer-friendly page. Things shouldn’t be this way.

Things shouldn’t be this way. Not in Python.
