Today's static site generators require css, markup, templating and programming skills. Their compatibility is broken. 
A template in one framework doesn't work in the other. You can't mix and match languages, and add custom features in
a decoupled way. You can't take a Designer's template and pipe data structures and lambdas. And then you check for
hosting, browser compatibility, plugins that blow on your face. 
 
These toolkits are built for a different skillset. It requires a lot of work to perform simple tasks. Things shouldnâ€™t 
be this way. Not in Python.
